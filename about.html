        <h2>We are a scientific organization</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to inspire the coming generations to explore the universe. </p>
        <p>In the Science Mission Directorate (SMD), the Astrophysics division studies the universe. The science goals of the SMD Astrophysics Division are breathtaking: we seek to understand the universe and our place in it. We are starting to investigate the very moment of creation of the universe and are close to learning the full history of stars and galaxies. We are discovering how planetary systems form and how environments hospitable for life develop. And we will search for the signature of life on other worlds, perhaps to learn that we are not alone.</p>

        <p>Our goal in Astrophysics is to "Discover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars." Three broad scientific questions emanate from these goals.</p>    
        
        <p>How does the universe work? - Probe the origin and destiny of our universe, including the nature of black holes, dark energy, dark matter and gravity.
        How did we get here? - Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars and planets that make up our universe.
        Are we alone? - Discover and study planets around other stars, and explore whether they could harbor life.
        The National Academies have started work on the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics.  Please visit the "2020 Decadal Planning" page for additional information about survey.</p>

        <h3>Current Programs</h3>
        <p>Astrophysics comprises of three focused and two cross-cutting programs. These focused programs provide an intellectual framework for advancing science and conducting strategic planning. They include:</p>

        <p>Physics of the Cosmos</p>
        <p>Cosmic Origins</p>
        <p>Exoplanet Exploration</p>
        <p>Astrophysics Explorer Program</p>
        <p> Astrophysics Research</p>
 
        <h3>Current Missions</h3>
        <p>Astrophysics current missions include three of the Great Observatories originally planned in the 1980s and launched over the past 28 years. The current suite of operational Great Observatories include the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Additionally, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope explores the high-energy end of the spectrum. Innovative Explorer missions, such as the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, NuSTAR, TESS, as well as Mission of Opportunity NICER, complement the Astrophysics strategic missions. SOFIA, an airborne observatory for infrared astronomy, is in its operational phase. All of the missions together account for much of humanity's accumulated knowledge of the heavens. Many of these missions have achieved their prime science goals, but continue to produce spectacular results in their extended operations.</p>

        <p>We-funded investigators also participate in observations, data analysis and developed instruments for the astrophysics missions of our international partners, including ESA's XMM-Newton.</p>

 
        <h3>Near Future</h3>    
        <p>The near future will be dominated by several missions. Currently in development, with especially broad scientific utility, is the James Webb Space Telescope. Also in work are detectors for ESA's Euclid mission and hardware for JAXA's XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy) to provide breakthroughs in the study of structure formation of the universe, outflows from galaxy nuclei, and dark matter.</p>

        <p>Completing the missions in development, supporting the operational missions, and funding the research and analysis programs will consume most of the Astrophysics Division resources.</p>    

        <p>In February 2016, We formally started the top Astro2010 decadal recommendation, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). WFIRST will aid researchers in their efforts to unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, and explore the evolution of the cosmos. It will also discover new worlds outside our solar system and advance the search for worlds that could be suitable for life.</p>
